John Wick Hex is a fast-paced, action-oriented strategy game that makes you think and strike like John Wick, the professional hitman of the critically acclaimed film franchise. Created in close cooperation with the creative teams behind the films, John Wick Hex is fight-choreographed chess brought to life as a video game, capturing the series’ signature gun fu style while expanding its story universe. Players must make quick decisions and choose every action and attack they make, all the while considering their immediate cost and consequences. Featuring a unique blend of strategic time-based action, John Wick Hex captures the feel of the tactical combat from the films and blurs the line between the strategy and action video game genres. Perform well and progress in the main story mode to unlock new weapons, suit options and locations. Each weapon changes up the tactics you’ll use and the manner in which you’ll play. Ammo is finite and realistically simulated, so time your reloads and make the most of weapons you scavenge on the job. Experience an original new story set prior to the events of the films which sees John on a desperate mission to rescue Winston and Charon from a dangerous new adversary seeking his birthright. This story is brought to life by the world class voice talents of Ian McShane and Lance Reddick, reprising their iconic roles from the films, and voice acting legend Troy Baker, joining the stellar cast as the game's eponymous villain 'Hex'.

Astral Pixel,7.49,73,Action|Platformer|2D|,E,"This game is immediately fun and definitely unique among other precision platformers. It clearly draws a lot of inspiration from super meat boy as far as level design goes and the very precise nature of the platforming, much like other games in that genre that SMB spawned. However it comes with a completely unique set of gameplay mechanics and an amazing art style. It is more mature than super meat boy and at the same time more kid friendly. I was skeptical when I downloaded the demo, thinking it would be a fairly bland dime a dozen platformer. However I was very quickly intrigued by the unique controls and mechanic and I bought it right away. Then very quickly I was charmed by the art style and the characters. Yes it is a platformer and there isn’t depth to the story or character back story. But there is charm in droves. It’s very lighthearted and warm. And once you understand the mechanic you pretty naturally pick it up and learn on pace with the level design. It is not overly difficult as far as these style of games go. It’s forgiving and it teaches you what you need to know very effectively.  I was very pleasantly surprised by the thought and care that went into this game and I really want more people to try it and see for themselves.

Wonderland Kazakiri inc.,7.60,76,Strategy|Turn-Based|General|,E,"BQM fills a niche which so far seems to be ignored on the Switch of a user generated level builder.  In a few more months there will be a juggernaut filling this hole with Super Mario Maker 2, but I feel that BQM will still be a worthy complement to SMM2 since it is more related to Zelda-like dungeon crawlers than side scroll SMB based levels.  Due to a lack of user reviews I held off on purchasing this title until it recently went on sale.  I am happy to report that BQM has turned out to be mostly what I hoped it would be.  There are a reasonable number of themed building blocks, monster types and traps that users can unlock for content creation.  A game like this requires a solid base of creators and I feel that the current community involvement is sufficient for the cost of the title.  My largest complaint about the game is that the game is basically crippled when not connected to the internet.  It would be nice to be able to queue up some levels to play on the go.  Also it would be nice to have a few more conditional switch options for level creation.  Ideally there would be at least one item which the user can define on a per instance basis to be ""AND"", ""NOT"", or ""OR"".  Aside from these complains I feel that BQM is a must for anybody who enjoys user generated content and/or mini dungeon crawlers.  Even at full price there is a lot of bang for your buck here.  Note to developer: If any of the developers are reading this review, I would suggest making a free demo for this game to improve the visibility.  Since this game is highly dependent on a large and active community of users it may also be helpful if you allow demo users to generate one or two free small levels that they can share to get a feel for the editor and increase the amount of content for everybody.",Wonderland Kazakiri inc.,BQM - BlockQuest Maker-,"Jan 10, 2019"

If you've ever enjoyed a beat-em-up or a runner, you will likely enjoy this. It's a fast paced beat-em-up type game with minor RPG elements which has you constantly running through wave after wave of enemies, either slashing them with your swords or throwing your ninja stars at them. The visuals are bright and cheerful, and the cast of characters are just as enjoyable. There is a HUGE variety in equipment, the selection of different weapons and passive abilities to use and experiment with is huge, and it will all genuinely affect how you play and require some strategy in how you plan your character. The different enemies are all so creative and require varying strategies from one another to defeat. Different combinations of enemies prove to consistently be challenging and interesting to fight throughout the entire game as well. The game paces its difficulty extremely well and the later stages are genuinely really difficult even in co-op. The co-op itself is integrated into the game so well, both online and local co-op is quick and easy to use - and playing in co-op doesn't make the game that much easier surprisingly - it is very well balanced. The game would be a blast with or without a buddy to play with, I think it might work best with two players however. The game has a really nice and crisp pixel art style with some retro-inspired music to accompany it which is just so great to listen to while playing. It's a really neat, simple little game which tries to be nothing except fun, and it is, it is really fun.

Hobibox,8.20,79,Adventure|Visual Novel|,M,"I'm coming into this game after playing Steins;Gate Elite, which was one of my all-time favorite games. It very well may be the best visual novel I've ever played, in my opinion. I just wanted to make clear before I give my review that I have never played the original 2009 Steins;Gate game. Steins;Gate 0 came out about 6 years after that game. While I'm almost one hundred percent sure that, other than localization, the concept writing is obviously what takes up most of the development time for the Chiyomaru games, I will go ahead & criticize the art for this game. I know there are many hardcore S;G fans who religiously appreciate the designs from Huke, even to the point that some fans denounce the considerably well done anime & upgraded version of the first game I already mentioned, Steins;Gate Elite, done by White Fox. Unfortunately for S;G0, there were several times where there wasn't a sprite made at all for scenes, I even got tired of the character backdrops that got used instead of new sprites. While I enjoy the art Huke has done, I think it's horribly inexcusable that SO many sprites were reused from the original game. I'm not necessarily blaming Huke, here. However, it was clear despite never having played the original that many sprites got used from the 6-years-older original, which is incredibly sloppy to me. Normally this wouldn't really bother me... but the sprites that are updated with winter outfits look very different than the original sprites, so the reused ones look extremely bizarre to be included. This is even more apparent with how different the styles are when the setting is in summer again & you're seeing new characters next to the reused summer sprites. There were also many, many lines with the ""lip sync"" turned on that the mouth did not animate at all while characters were speaking. I'm unsure about if the time allotted for development was the issue, if it was money, or what, but I hate seeing such a high quality written visual novel look so clearly cheaply made. Which brings me to the positive notes I had: this was still a very good story with characters I love. The voice acting is excellent & the sound design, as expected, is incredible. The music is very well composed & makes for a great tone setting. I was surprised about the Switch port not having any changes made to the several mistakes in the script, but for how many lines there are, there really aren't that many discrepancies (other than with the RINE text messages, sometimes those didn't make sense at all). Also the auto scroll feature is in dire need of adjustment, even at max speed the non-voiced sections move about four times slower than the voiced dialogue. I don't know how the original S;G handled its multiple endings, but I do wish the flags for the choices diverging was much more clear, but it's very easy to just look up how to achieve all the endings without getting spoiled. I know it sounds like I was very down on this game, but I did enjoy my time with it. Hopefully the upcoming Steins;Gate 0 Elite will be on par with Steins;Gate Elite and remedy my issues with the art in particular.",Spike Chunsoft,Steins;Gate 0,"Dec 10, 2019"
