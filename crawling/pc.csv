"You'll battle cultists, gargoyles, zombies, hellhounds, and an unholy host of other terrors in your quest to stop Tchernobog. You must not only defeat the Cabal--you must scour its dread name from human memory. If that means eradicating everyone and everything the Cabal has ever tainted, so be it. Of course, you'll first have to make your way through fortresses, castles, mines, mansions, and estates guarded and kept by Tchernobog's malevolent servants. Fortunately, it is wits that make the hero, and although you're in serious danger of losing yours, you've got enough left to improvise some pretty effective tools of destruction. Aerosol hairspray can be frightening enough on its own, but apply it to a lighter flame and you've got an instant flamethrower (kids, don't try this at home!). Likewise, a flare gun can brighten your prospects considerably against even the grimmest odds, which is to say nothing for shotguns, Tommy guns, and dynamite.

In Red Alert 3, the desperate leadership of a doomed Soviet Union travels back in time to change history and restore the glory of Mother Russia. The time travel mission goes awry, creating an alternate timeline where technology has followed an entirely different evolution, a new superpower has been thrust on to the world stage, and World War III is raging. The Empire of the Rising Sun has risen in the East, making World War III a three-way struggle between the Soviets, the Allies, and the Empire with armies fielding wacky and wonderful weapons and technologies like Tesla coils, heavily armed War Blimps, teleportation, armored bears, intelligent dolphins, floating island fortresses, and transforming tanks. Red Alert 3 asks the question ""What If?"" What if every bizarre research project and technology experiment for the last 70 years had actually borne fruit? What if the Philadelphia Experiment, time travel theory, teleportation, invisibility, Tesla technology, and a hundred other intriguing research projects had all paid off and gone mainstream? What if the Soviet Union survived and thrived; what would it look like 10 years in the future? What if the Japanese Empire had never fallen and instead became the ultimate high-tech military superpower?

"A wonderful, cute little adventure game with a good story, minor RPG elements, some light hearted humor and plenty of content, Creepy Castle promises and it delivers. The game is segmented across 5 different scenarios, which I will cover in as brief and non-spoilery a way as possible: The first scenario, Creepy Castle, is the only one you have unlocked to begin with, and your character, Moth, is tasked with entering the creepy castle and figuring out what's going on inside. After that, you unlock 3 of the remaining 4 scenarios (the other one is best left as a surprise): Ghostly Mystery, Depth, and Due Exaltation, which are all branches off of the original story. Ghostly Mystery involves you delving into the mysterious ghost palace shortly after the events of the first scenario, and is thematically similar to it as well. The next scenario, Depth, is all about being hopelessly lost in a labyrinthine cave system, and sadly this has little story until the end. Next is Due Exaltation, a space adventure where you... actually, I think I'll leave that for you to find out. After a scenario is completed, you will usually be given the scenario's free mode, where you can replay the scenario with any character you wish.

The game allows the player to fight across iconic locations from the famous island-hopping campaigns in the Pacific from 1942 to 1945, as the US Army and Marine Corps fight it out with the Imperial Japanese army and Special Naval Landing Forces. Players experience beach assaults, jungle fighting, close quarters night fighting and more across Guadalcanal, Iwo Jima and Saipan, among other iconic battles. The player is able to take the part of either side – American or Japanese – battling it out online in multiplayer on up to 64-player servers. Rising Storm also introduces an entirely new type of gameplay to the franchise - asymmetrical warfare. The American’s have the apparent advantage in firepower with their fast firing semi-automatic rifles, fully automatic weapons, and devastating flamethrower. The Japanese balance this out with gameplay elements that model their raw courage, ferocity, and cunning use of equipment. Their knee mortars allow them to rain indirect fire down on their enemies from anywhere in the map. Grenades can be planted and turned into booby-traps for unwary GIs. The Japanese put very high store on close-quarter combat, with a bayonet on almost every weapon – even machine guns and SMGs.

"Wizards Dark times is a decent game for Rift S with cool gesture-summoning which makes you feel super cool summoning fireballs, shields and heaps of other cool stuff. There is no shortage of spells and they are great and work well with the teleporting mechanic since you are a wizard, so if makes perfect sense as a way to move around. But there are a lot of bugs with teleporting which will get you stuck and greatly limits any exploration, making the experience feel cripplingly linear considering all the cool spells you have to play with. I would have liked some choice on pathing so you can actually use your spells for something other than just combat. The initial novelty of using gestures to summon spells wears off fairly fast and actually my favourite weapon - the ice bow - often got mixed with other very similar gestures, making it basically unusable later in the game. The first hour or so was an absolute blast, but it becomes incredibly repetetive later on and I found I had to force myself to reach the ending which turned out to be quite disappointing anyway.

"People who rated this game less than 8 are wrong, they rate it as a remake not a remaster. Expecting new AI ? New mechanics ? Really ? Know the difference between remaster and remake, because you end up looking like a retard. Remaster is usually up-scaled graphics, its improvements like UI and better sound quality, you got that here and much, much more that didn't have to be in a remaster. But there is. You get additional un-lockable bonuses, console missions, custom maps and mods ready to instant download, customisable soundtrack play-list and ability to switch between remastered graphics and sounds. Lastly you get all of command and conquer (including console missions), red alert and all their expansions for just 20€ / 20$. Price, quality and minor bugs (that i only heard of because i didn't encounter them) are worth this money. This is perfect remaster that you can get.

"Naked War is a light hearted, turn-based, battle game for two players, played on Windows PCs over email. Its a Community Messaging Game. Each game is played on an island where two squads of up to four soldiers battle each other for supremacy. The player takes the role of a military officer, issuing strategic commandings to his / her squad, then watching the resulting battle unfold. Games are started by players sending out Challenges to anybody they know - either exisiting Naked War players in their in-game address book, or real life friends or acquiantences via their email address list. Each player takes it in turn to plan the movement of their four units. Each unit is allowed up to seven 'moves' per turn, and can move, attack, enter buildings, drive tanks and other vehicles or use items, etc., each move. Once the player has set up all the moves for their four units, he / she clicks the send button, which sends an email to their opponent containing this turn (in the form of an attached file), then plays back the turn on their PC, showing both players the results of the planned moves. When a player receives a turn in their email Inbox, they simply double click the attachment to launch Naked War, which plays back the turn received then allows the player to set up their own turn in reply. Each soldier in the game starts with a 'doofer', but looses it to their attacker if the damage inflicted is great enough to 'demob' the soldier, losing their uniform and making them naked! The aim of the game is for one team to defeat the other by gaining control of all the doofers, and the winner is declared at the end of the turn where the last doofer changes hands. Each turn is played offline at whatever time is convenient to the player. There is no need for both players to be on-line at the same time, or playing at the same time. Turns can be replied to instantly, during lunchtime, or at the end of the day, or they can wait in your Inbox for days until the you are ready to respond. The average turns take only a few minutes to set up and play back, and a game can take anything from as little as 10 turns, up to 50 or more before there is a winner, depending on the complexity of the map and the relative skill of the players involved.

Featuring strategic team play, persistent character promotions, day and nighttime combat missions, and the universe's most powerful weapons and vehicles, the game transports players to the front lines of an epic new war for Earth. As the invasion begins, players choose to battle as one of five unique classes in either the EDF (Earth Defense Force - humans) or the barbaric alien Strogg armies, each augmented with specialist weapons and combat hardware.  Troops utilize over 40 conventional and futuristic vehicles, deployable structures, and defense systems like quad-bikes, tanks, and alien walkers for epic ground assaults; or helicopters and anti-gravity ships to lend firepower from the air.   Throughout each battle, teams establish bases, deploy defense structures, artillery, radar, and advanced forward-command systems into enemy territory while constructing and demolishing obstacles to speed progress and gain a tactical advantage over the enemy. Players can take on class specific missions or join a fireteam to utilize advanced command and communication options, including voice-chat and the game's context sensitive mission order system.

"From the mind of Will Wright comes SPORE, a journey that takes you from the origin and evolution of life through the development of civilization and technology and eventually all the way into the deepest reaches of outer space. Begin your odyssey at the dawn of life as a simple microbe just trying to survive, then use the fun, intuitive Editors to evolve the creature from its microscopic origins into an intelligent, tool-using race. Guide your species as it builds (and the player designs) villages, buildings, cities, and vehicles. Along the way to becoming a global civilization you can choose whether to hunt or forage, attack or trade, be nice or play rough. All the action takes place in a huge, lush world populated with creatures evolved by other players and shared over SPORE's central servers. When it's ready, your one-time pond scum launches into space in its UFO on a grand voyage of discovery, planet forming, or destruct-ion. As you explore and play in this limitless universe of unique worlds, your personal Sporepedia tracks all the creatures you've met and places you've visited. Take complete control of your creature's fate as you guide it through the following six evolutionary phases: Tidepool phase: Fight with other creatures and consume them to adjust the form and abilities of your creature. It's survival of the fittest at the most microscopic level. Creature phase: Venture onto dry land and help your creature learn and evolve with forays away from your safe haven. Carnivore or Herbivore? Social or Independent? The choice is yours. Tribal phase: Instead of controlling an individual creature, you are now caring for an entire tribe of your genetic craftwork. Give them tools and guide their interactions as you slowly upgrade their state of existence. City phase: Bring your creatures' race into a new golden era by building up the technology, architecture, and infrastructure of their city. Civilization phase: Once your city is established, your creatures begin seeking out and interacting with other cultures. You can have them do so with an olive branch or a war cry—either way, the goal for your creatures is to unify the planet. Space phase: The time has come to move on to other worlds in your solar system.

"Long ago, the galaxy had known peace. Paradise was ruled with the hand of science, and the hand was that of the galactic governing body known as the Core. Ironically, it was the Core's ultimate victory, the victory over death itself, that brought about the downfall of its paradise and started the war that would decimate a million worlds. The immortality process, known as ""patterning,"" involved the electronic duplication of brain matrices, allowing the transfer of consciousness into durable machines. Effectively it meant immortality, and the Core decreed the process mandatory for all citizens in order to ensure their safety. However, there were many citizens unwilling to toss aside their bodies so casually, many indeed who regarded patterning as an atrocity. They fled to the outer edges of the galaxy, forming a resistance movement that became known as the Arm. War began, though it was never officially declared by either side. The Arm developed high-powered combat suits for its armies, while the Core transferred the minds of its soldiers directly into similarly deadly machines. The Core duplicated its finest warriors thousands of times over. The Arm countered with a massive cloning program. The war raged on for more than 4,000 years, consuming the resources of an entire galaxy and leaving it a scorched wasteland.

"The Overlord pack adds a little of everything that will keep the player interested and expand the Mass Effect story. The main feature of this content is that it contains a new planet to explore, both on foot and by a new hovercraft style Cerberus vehicle, the M-44 Hammerhead. While vehicles were present in the first game, Mass Effect 2 did slightly lack the planet free-roam, which is why the Overlord pack is a refreshing change. It also provides some natural obstacles that the player will need to overcome with the vehicle, such as crossing lava flows and reaching higher locations using steam vents. There are four assignments overall, which does make this pack a slightly longer experience than the previous costing DLC's, around two hours of content, perhaps more depending on the difficulty. The assignments all follow on from each other and therefore all need to be completed in a set order, which is both gripping and intriguing, as each assignment leads you on to the next. There are several Renegade and Paragon dialogue options in the content which will allow the player to tailor make the decisions and outcomes of the final assignment. The Overload DLC doesn't seem to be dependant on the player having completed the final story missions of the main game, so the content could be played before or after, depending on when the player may see fit to start it. Overall the pack is a great edition to the Mass Effect story and is a welcomed addition for any fan of the series. It has beautiful locations and buildings, new, and not recycled from earlier in the game. It is a shame there is only four short assignments as the free-roam planet and vehicle exploration could have led to several side-missions and quests, but all in all, a solid piece of content.","Jun 15, 2010",EA Games,86,Mass Effect 2: Overlord,Role-Playing|Action RPG|Action RPG|,7.2,BioWare,T

"Even as a rage game that's supposed to make you angry, Thumper is the best rhythm game i have ever played. I went through the campaign to the end, and this is the first time i've done this with any rhythm game ever. The angry drumbeats of the ""music"" you're making is meant to get you riled up. The game uses your heat-in-the-moment feelings to aid your performance. Good memorization of the patterns will get you very far as well. The controls are quite simple, you can get most movements done with the space bar or the X button. And the campaign mode is wonderful too. In the later game, you'll get the feeling that you aren't supposed to win, and i guess that's why Drool chose a beetle as your character.

"WOW! For about ten years Paradox Development have been a small team of nice guys working hard to give us good games and mostly failing. Their games have been for the most part tedious, pretentious and ugly, with cluttered mechanisms, and hideous micromanagement. Most of the Paradox efforts suffered from terrible tutorials and ridiculous learning curved that discouraged any vaguely casual gamers. But beyond inaccessibility, the games were finally not that good, because even when you figured out the mechanisms they were still too MECHANICAL: not even really worth learning in the end because they were all variations of a sausage machine. However something miraculous happened with Crusaders Kings 2, and echoes of the good things we saw in earlier games (Hearts of Iron 2) reappeared: Better looking graphics. Simpler, yet DEEPER gameplay.  The machine kept churning away but Paradox learned to save us from the worst of it, and the gameplay began to blossom. Europa Universalis IV seems to demonstrate that Paradox has really turned the corner. The game is beautiful.  Gameplay is fluid. The depth and complication is welcome, but it has been softened with a more thoughtful and gaming friendly structure! GREAT WORK PARADOX! Good things take time, and your grand ambitions are finally bearing fruit. I'm very excited about where this will lead with the Hearts of Iron series, because all the design wisdom that we can see in CK2 and EU4 is leading in the absolute correct direction. If you love strategy gaming please go and buy this game and support this developer! This is a FAR, FAR superior game to Civilizations 1-5 as well as anything put out by Creative Assembly. It's been a long wait but worth it. Can't wait to see what we get when the final few pieces of the game design puzzle fall into place. If they get the budget to build something with a more solid multiplayer experience we will see the PERFECT game.","Aug 13, 2013",Paradox Interactive,87,Europa Universalis IV,Strategy|Real-Time|Historic|General|Historic|,8.7,Paradox Development Studio,T

"This game is outstanding. One of the best games I've played to date. First off, the visuals and music are so polished and beautiful. I just want every screen of this game as my background (the backgrounds are incredibly detailed and help make the game feel very polished) and I could listen to this music for hours. I mean, each level has it's own death transition! That should give you a taste of how much love the developers put into this game. The dialogue is incredibly charming and tells a story about complicated feelings so elegantly and with so much honesty (I mean, you can feel it through the dialogue). The gameplay is incredibly fluid and its difficulty curve is perfect (However, I am a platformer afficiando, so take that with a grain of salt). I mean, seriously. Just jumping around and dashing in an empty space feels amazing, and there are so many collectibles to find using these amazing controls! You can choose to play on assist mode, or complete the game 100% and have an outstanding time no matter what. This game simply gets everything right: from skippable cutscenes to counters that help see what you missed in a level. The B-sides are just as fun as the main story and there's secrets hiding in every corner. No secret makes you want to use a walkthrough; they are well-hidden, but also well telegraphed with fun little mini-challenges in them. There are so many cool, inventive mechanics to come across while traversing through in this game... and the level design... Oh, the level design! It's absolutely perfect. This game is incredible and a great start if you want to start playing hardcore platformers.","Jan 25, 2018",Matt Makes Games Inc.,88,Celeste,Action|Platformer|2D|,8.3,Matt Makes Games Inc.,None

"Empire: Total War is set in the 18th century, a turbulent era that is the most requested by Total War’s loyal fan base and a period alive with global conflict, revolutionary fervour and technological advances. The game features themes such as the Industrial Revolution, America's struggle for independence, the race to control Eastern trade routes and the globalisation of war on land and sea. Empire: Total War sees the debut of 3D naval combat within the Total War franchise. PC Gamers intuitively command vast fleets or single ships upon seascapes rich with extraordinary water and weather effects that play a huge role in your eventual glorious success or ignominious defeat. After pummelling your enemy with cannon fire, close in to grapple their ship and prepare to board taking control your men as they fight hand to hand on the decks. Empire: Total War also sees further enhancements to the Total War series signature 3D battles and turn based campaign map. Real time battles pose new challenges with the addition of cannon and musket, challenging players to master new formations and tactics as a result of the increasing role of gunpowder within warfare. And the Campaign Map – for many the heart of Total War – will see new improved systems for Trade, Diplomacy and Espionage with agents, a refined and streamlined UI, improved Advisors and extended scope taking in the riches of India, the turbulence of Europe and the untapped potential of North America.

"Arsenal's Thierry Henry and Chelsea's John Terry stare out from the box of Pro Evolution Soccer 5, both men at the top of their game in the Premiership, and both are die-hard fans of the PES series. The retuned controls in the 2005 edition give players more control over weighted passes, one-twos, and so on. This ties in with the improved animation, which not only looks more realistic, but requires you to time kicks and shots perfectly for maximum power - you're more likely to scuff the ball and make weak, inaccurate shots if you attempt to play them while off balance or out of step. In order for you to enjoy the full benefit of the updated controls, Training Mode is extended - rewarding efforts with points used to unlock secrets within the game. The new licensed clubs are all meticulously detailed, including the authentic representation of names and numbers on their backs. Increased detail in all players has been transferred to the Player Design mode, which has been hugely expanded to include more factors determining skill and ability. Master League, in which you guide a lowly team to glory, now allows player-managers to monitor individual players and see when their health declines and includes European teams. In all games, weather conditions can be set to 'variable', leading to patchy rain or snow. The new weather conditions further enhance the realism and unpredictable nature of PES matches.

"The shocking truth that so many people would never really want to consider here, is that Cataclysm is not only a fantastic sequel, but hands down- the best game in the series.  What we can immediately pull away from the amazing presentation is the knowledge that a very intelligent developer named ""Barking Dog Studios"" saw the potential for the series and worked very hard to make it a better experience all around.  If anyone hasn't played Homeworld in a while, you'll remember that it had a fantastically executed story held back just a smidge by occasionally buggy fleet A.I., a killer difficulty curve after the 3rd mission, an almost unfair amount of frustration at times, and of course some cumbersome interface quirks.  This has really all been cleared up by Barking Dog, since not only have they patched and filled some of the irksome frustrations of the interface, but they've completely cleaned up the issue with unit balance as well.  Incorporating a unit cap was an incredibly good idea, it adds quite a bit more strategy in when you choose to build your units.  Though this was frowned upon as an overall game-changing mechanic, I thought it made unit preservation that much more important.  And with how much faster paced Cataclysm is compared to its predecessor- it makes a good deal of sense to implement that feature.  Without getting too much into the story, the actual flow of combat is what really drove me to enjoy this game over and over again.  The back and forth of the main factions in game are nothing short of nerve-racking.  Slowly preparing a fleet to do battle with a foe that can reverse your technology and assimilates your ships is terrifying and incredibly interesting.  Working out the balance of your fleet, researching new ways to counter your borg-like foe are all part of the campaign as well as the skirmish modes.  To mention briefly the sound design is nothing short of brilliant, its much more engaging than the original game, though some of the voice work does sound a little goofy initially, overall its very well implemented as well.  The atmospheric soundtrack is back, and though it doesn't feature anything that standouts as well as the first game, it is still very good.  The games engine itself was starting to see some gray hairs unfortunately, so of course it was polished as well as it could be for 2000.  Between the much more involved story line, the pacing of various space battle, the more efficient research and harvesting system- the game easily outdoes 1999's origin tale.  If not by design alone, it certainly features a much more engaging plot that really goes all out in conveying the urgency of stopping your mistake that was born from foolish ignorance.  If you have always wondered what the best ""sequel"" was, this is it, this is the actual ""Homeworld 2"" and their is really nothing like it inside the real time strategy genre.","Sep  7, 2000",Sierra Entertainment,89,Homeworld: Cataclysm,Strategy|Real-Time|Sci-Fi|Sci-Fi|General|,8.8,Barking Dog,E

Within a quest you have unprecedented freedom and power to manipulate the world around you: your magic can build bridges and open up new pathways, or it can burn down forests and tear the ground asunder. You don't have to spend countless hours on a leveling treadmill to get to the interesting parts of the game, because combat is designed to be strategically interesting and challenging right from the beginning. You don't have to spend hours running around the world to prepare for a quest, because Guild Wars allows you to instantly travel to the beginning of any quest that you've previously unlocked. You'll never spend days playing only to discover that choices you made early on have left you with a permanently uncompetitive character, because the unique skill system in Guild Wars allows infinite experimentation but doesn't allow bad decisions to ruin a character.

"Rome: Total War is the next generation in epic strategy gaming from the critically acclaimed and award winning Total War brand. The aim of the game is to conquer, rule and manipulate the Roman Empire with the ultimate goal of being declared as the ""Imperator"" of Rome. Set in a time when the mighty Roman Empire emerged to conquer the known world against powerful enemies; when gladiators fought to a bloody death in the Coliseum; when Spartacus defied the might of the empire; when Hannibal led his invincible army and his war elephants across the Alps to strike fear into the very heart of Rome itself; and when Julius Caesar finally smashed the Barbarian Gauls. This was a time of brutal confrontation between civilisation and barbarism, and of civil war as the ancient world's only superpower turned on itself. A completely new Total War engine uses innovative technology and groundbreaking design to bring the world of ancient Rome to life to deliver the biggest and most cinematic battles ever seen in a videogame.
