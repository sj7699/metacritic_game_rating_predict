However, if I was being a severe critic of realism I could say that the old school days of arcade NBA Jam style are still alive & well in this version of 2k. This, for Me, makes this My ATF (All-Time Fav) hoops game, & on the PS4 it's just absolutely gorgeous. The only gripe for true purists will be the over-the-top WWEish MyCareer mode which includes cheesy cut-scenes & the innately annoying knack for your counterpart to always be catching fire & carrying his team to an unrealistic degree. Having said that, when you're dropping 20 & 10 in your rookie showcase game you can understand the developers pushing your competition. For those who enjoyed catching fire in the heyday of NBA Jam you'll LOVE 2k14's varying levels of getting \"ON FIRE!!\", including defensively if you make a few good plays on D (steals, blocks, etc). The visuals are stunning, presentation is as realistic as I've ever seen & they even use the Real Voice feature to have real coaches & players during interviews. The online is a different twist on park hoops which allows you to watch & join games going on live by calling \"next\". There's more modes than you'll even have time for which makes for an overwhelmingly awesome full package. NBA 2k14 is the Best Basketball Game Ever. Good luck NBA Live!!! lol\n",

This compilation in combination with 'Kingdom Hearts 2.8: Final Chapter Prologue' offers the perfect way to catch up on the story of one of the most beloved series in gaming history up to this point for quite a decent price. There were some issues when the game first launched mainly due to the 60 frames per second upgrade (excessively fast animations, save crashes and some others); however, Square Enix have thus far been proactive on these issues -- introducing 2 patches within the last two weeks leading up to the English release proving they have indeed listened to community feedback. So far, I have had a flawless experience with this game! The 60 frames per second is smooth and works really well in this entry just as well as it did in Kingdom Hearts 2.8: Dream Drop Distance.\n",

The puzzles are pitched at just the right level that they don't delay you too long, but you still feel clever when you work them out. However it's the VR implementation that really shines for me - never before have I felt so in-touch with a VR world - subtle use of the controller vibration and some clever tricks really gave objects in the world a tactile sensation. I spent about 5 minutes just lifting up a dumbbell and a pot-plant trying to work out what the game was doing that made one of them \"feel\" heavier than the other. Outstanding. A little spooky in places but doesn't resort to any cheap jump-scares. Give it a go, you wont be disappointed.\n",

Understand it was a divisive decision and may not be everyone's cup of tea but personally going full RPG was IMHO one bold but brilliant move. Graphics was stunning especially around the Yokohama port area. Music was absolutely awesome not as good as Persona or FF7R but fairly close I reckon. It's got its drawbacks (somewhat grindy, I didn't really find the story too compelling) and definitely not a 10/10 game (more like 9/10) but I'm giving it full score to offset the extremely unfair 0 that some people were giving.\n",

Simply put, the YouTube comparisons don't do this collection justice, because the texture quality has been bumped up by a lot in all three games. Moreover, each game runs in 1080p and presents a crisp and vibrant image compared to the washed out and blurry image of the last gen versions. Frame rate is also 60 FPS in all with some dips here and there. There is also no day one patch for any of the titles, so you can play these games out of the box without a problem.
