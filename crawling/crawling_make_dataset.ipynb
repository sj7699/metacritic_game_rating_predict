Moreover, each game runs in 1080p and presents a crisp and vibrant image compared to the washed out and blurry image of the last gen versions.

      "The ultimate version of Disgaea 4. It has of cause the main game and all content from “Disgaea 4 A promise revisited” including all additional characters, scenarios, gameplay improvements with some from other Disgaea games and some tweaks to the game.  For this game they add a few things that you might miss but are nice to have like for example skill speed ups or an auto save after battles. For me this is the complete or ultimate version of my favorite Disgaea game. The enjoyable crazy story, dark humor, quirky characters and excellent gameplay won me over. To give you an overview over the Disgaea franchise: The Disgaea series are strategy RPGs with unique characters, dark humor and endless possibilities to improve your characters. While other RPGs cap at level 99 here you can reach level 9999 (no typo) and even reincarnate to increase you stats further. You can improve your skills and items also. There is an item world where you can improve all items to ridiculous levels. You can also throw teammates (do this carefully with Prinnies) and later games use fusions and other interesting mechanics. Then there is the humor and characters. It is well interwoven and there are so much good jokes, side-blows and sarcasm. The story is always a good mixture of awesomeness, seriousness, humor and enjoyable character quirks. All games shine in this regard and so far there is no weak entry. The story evolves around a new cast of characters. The main character Valvatorez is a vampire who has not drunk blood in ages because of a promise which weakened him (He was ultimate secret boss level strong back then and a legend). He is a man of his word, non-corruptible and knows well about Sardines. The werewolf Fenrich has chosen him as his master and is his right hand man, absolute loyal but with own ideas. For the rest I avoid spoilers a bit. There is a girl who thinks everything is a dream, a final boss in training, a grim-reaper and a greedy person. Those have great chemistry and work well. Each game has a fantastic cast but those won me over the most. The story starts simple but escalates into a wild and enjoyable ride. So much dark humor, crazy ideas and twist. I fully admit you must like this kind of craziness but if you do not why even play a Disgaea game? In the story and character regard this game fully delivers. The gameplay is great too. It is a turn based strategy RPG. You know the drill here. Move your characters on the map. Attack use your abilities and defeat your enemies. However the Disgaea games have more than most other games. You have colored Geo panels with pyramids given effects. Destroying them can cause chain reactions that damage all characters on them. You can throw characters, build towers with characters, fuse monsters or equip monster characters as weapons, improve items in the item world or characters, gain items with a bonus gouge and much more. The game has a lot of depth and you can easily get 100 hours of playtime out of it in a single playthrough. If you play all content and want to see all I can easily see this past 300 hours. Here a bit of advice: For power leveling: Level 99 enemies give far more experience then they should by comparison. If you get skills that can vanquish a group of those you are fast in the several hundred levels. Stage 5.2 with increased difficulty to 8 is the best level up area for a while. You can link characters together in a way that 10% experience are gained which power level weaker characters in a few minutes. Evilities and skills are very useful and you should look out for them. Fused and monster character weapons are powerful if chosen correctly. Finally there are a lot of useful tricks to find and explore. Presentation wise the game looks and sound amazing. No misstep here and I am a huge fan of the style of the franchise. Overall this is my favorite version of my favorite game. A must play for Disgaea and RPG fans if you can endure the enjoyable craziness.\n",
