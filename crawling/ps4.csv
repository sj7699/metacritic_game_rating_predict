Not content to just rely on storytelling Owlboy also manages some fantastic traversal and combat that truly makes exploring the world a joy. Fantastically clever boss battles and dungeons push you to learn new skills with your companions while not being overly punishing. My only slight critique would be the lack of times juggling party members was necessary. The few times this did occur it was a delight to master how a particular problem would be best addressed by switching between characters on the fly (no pun intended). Old mechanics are rarely reused across dungeons which does rob you of some of those nice moments that come from building upon and mastering skills specific to puzzles and tasks you have previously completed throughout the game.
