"Jan 12, 2016",Stoic,Versus Evil,7.7,T,"A remarkable game. It is a mixture of a strategic RPG and survival management. The mixture of this made a challenging gameplay with lot of hard decision. Also the art style, soundtrack and graphics are unique and enhance the immersion. The world is inspired by Nordic aka Viking culture and mythology. Story: The goddess Loom Mother created the humans by learning to weave life into the world. The other gods wanted to do this too but had often not the skills or patience. Some imitated this by creating other races like the Varl (Giants) or Horseborn (Centaurs). One angry god however created the Dredge who are living humanoids out of stone to destroy the other races. He was punished by the Loom Mother but this ended accidentally with his dead to every gods shock as they thought themselves to be immortal. The gods then fought and killed themselves or are in hiding but there is no evidence for the last. Meanwhile the before fighting Varl and Humans made peace to repel the Dredge. They won and the Dredge seem to be gone. However many years later the sun stopped at the sky and the Dredge seem to return in numbers unlike before. This will be a struggle for survival. I like the story and the dread. You feel the menace and the harsh battle for survival. Together with the well done characters it is an immersive and enjoyable adventure. Game play: Firstly the strategic RPG parts. It is turn based but not with a speed attribute. You are in control of up to 6 characters per battle. Each side has alternating turns no mater the numbers except one is down to the last man standing. Example you have 6 characters so after 12 turns it is your same characters turn again. When the enemy has 8 it will be 16 before the same characters turn. Be careful! This is dangerous when you have spared the most powerful enemies until the end. You have an armor and health rating. Health is also attack power and this is an interesting concept. Lets say attack power 9 against armor 7  with 10 health. This is 9-7 = 2 damage and with this health is 10-2= 8. The possible damage output is lowered from also 10 to 8 for the damaged character. You can attack the armor instead but this is a separated lower value. You do at least 1 damage no mater the armor but with high differences the hit percentage is lower and lower. You have also willpower that can be added. You have a stock and a value for max adding. The value will be added to the result. Lets take the above example and use 2 willpower. Damage 9-7=2+2=4. Useful in many situation as it can also be used to increase moving range. The character level up with enough kills but you must pay the level up with more and more renown (See below) for this and it is not much status increase per level. Also you can equip better artifacts (only 1 per character) and each 2 levels your willpower based special skills get better but also more expensive. A simpler but really enjoyable system with some depth. Then there is the survival part. Some say it is similar to the classic “The Oregon Trail” but I think this is not familiar anymore. You are the leader of a caravan and must protect its people. You travel through the lands with them and must get food and this is also bought with renown points. You get those for defeating enemies and some events. It is harsh decision making between level up and buying more food. Starvation is a thing and more people need more food. There is a moral rating system and this will be also with benefits and penalties. There are random and scripted events where you have to made decisions. Your decisions mostly have consequences and you can gain or lose heroes, food, moral and people too. It is a cruel situation and as leader you have to make harsh decisions or let others pay the price. I forgot that defeated heroes need recovery time except on easy difficulty (And more on hard). You can still use them but they are really weakened. Resting improves moral, heals wounded heroes but it takes time and consumes food. I think this is a good set up and the rest is easy to learn. The game worked really well with its story, characters and challenges. Even normal gets really hard later on when you want to be noble leader and safe as many lives as possible. Then there is the graphics. It looks hand-drawn and the world and characters look amazing. Another game where I would buy an artbook. The soundtrack is truly good and I was amazed that they used artist I already cherish like Malukah, Peter Hollens and Taylor Davis. They have good YouTube channels by the way. With this the game is a masterpiece for me. Overall a good game creates emotion and has an addicting gameplay.

The only minor detraction I can find with the game is that sometimes it can become tiring to follow everything that happens if your mind starts to wander, but you can take a break whenever, so its not that big of a deal.  The Invisible Hours is also split up into chapters and they aren't too long so the pacing is well done and helps with breaks.  Despite the short chapters, the game has a lot of replay as there is a bunch of content to observe and it becomes more enriching with every subsequent play-through of the events.

"Oct 29, 2019",Nippon Ichi Software,NIS America,5.9,T,"The ultimate version of Disgaea 4. It has of cause the main game and all content from “Disgaea 4 A promise revisited” including all additional characters, scenarios, gameplay improvements with some from other Disgaea games and some tweaks to the game.  For this game they add a few things that you might miss but are nice to have like for example skill speed ups or an auto save after battles. For me this is the complete or ultimate version of my favorite Disgaea game. The enjoyable crazy story, dark humor, quirky characters and excellent gameplay won me over. To give you an overview over the Disgaea franchise: The Disgaea series are strategy RPGs with unique characters, dark humor and endless possibilities to improve your characters. While other RPGs cap at level 99 here you can reach level 9999 (no typo) and even reincarnate to increase you stats further. You can improve your skills and items also. There is an item world where you can improve all items to ridiculous levels. You can also throw teammates (do this carefully with Prinnies) and later games use fusions and other interesting mechanics. Then there is the humor and characters. It is well interwoven and there are so much good jokes, side-blows and sarcasm. The story is always a good mixture of awesomeness, seriousness, humor and enjoyable character quirks. All games shine in this regard and so far there is no weak entry. The story evolves around a new cast of characters. The main character Valvatorez is a vampire who has not drunk blood in ages because of a promise which weakened him (He was ultimate secret boss level strong back then and a legend). He is a man of his word, non-corruptible and knows well about Sardines. The werewolf Fenrich has chosen him as his master and is his right hand man, absolute loyal but with own ideas. For the rest I avoid spoilers a bit. There is a girl who thinks everything is a dream, a final boss in training, a grim-reaper and a greedy person. Those have great chemistry and work well. Each game has a fantastic cast but those won me over the most. The story starts simple but escalates into a wild and enjoyable ride. So much dark humor, crazy ideas and twist. I fully admit you must like this kind of craziness but if you do not why even play a Disgaea game? In the story and character regard this game fully delivers. The gameplay is great too. It is a turn based strategy RPG. You know the drill here. Move your characters on the map. Attack use your abilities and defeat your enemies. However the Disgaea games have more than most other games. You have colored Geo panels with pyramids given effects. Destroying them can cause chain reactions that damage all characters on them. You can throw characters, build towers with characters, fuse monsters or equip monster characters as weapons, improve items in the item world or characters, gain items with a bonus gouge and much more. The game has a lot of depth and you can easily get 100 hours of playtime out of it in a single playthrough. If you play all content and want to see all I can easily see this past 300 hours. Here a bit of advice: For power leveling: Level 99 enemies give far more experience then they should by comparison. If you get skills that can vanquish a group of those you are fast in the several hundred levels. Stage 5.2 with increased difficulty to 8 is the best level up area for a while. You can link characters together in a way that 10% experience are gained which power level weaker characters in a few minutes. Evilities and skills are very useful and you should look out for them. Fused and monster character weapons are powerful if chosen correctly. Finally there are a lot of useful tricks to find and explore. Presentation wise the game looks and sound amazing. No misstep here and I am a huge fan of the style of the franchise. Overall this is my favorite version of my favorite game. A must play for Disgaea and RPG fans if you can endure the enjoyable craziness.",83,Strategy|Turn-Based|Tactics|,Disgaea 4 Complete+

Having said that, when you're dropping 20 & 10 in your rookie showcase game you can understand the developers pushing your competition. For those who enjoyed catching fire in the heyday of NBA Jam you'll LOVE 2k14's varying levels of getting ""ON FIRE!!"", including defensively if you make a few good plays on D (steals, blocks, etc). The visuals are stunning, presentation is as realistic as I've ever seen & they even use the Real Voice feature to have real coaches & players during interviews.
