In this version the textures of the game are more compressed, so you can see that the game’s graphics are clearer and more detailed than before. You will also see that there is no loading time when you enter or exit a level, which makes the navigation even faster and more enjoyable. Ubisoft has also integrated a new Camera Mode on PS4. By pressing the touchpad of the PS4 joystick, you pause the game and enter this mode, and by moving your fingers on the touchpad, you zoom in and out on the image and drag the image frame; and finally, by pressing the Share button, you can take a photo and share it with everyone. This Camera Mode is a great way to observe in detail all the characters and settings of the game, and a great way of expression to create wacky images with the elements found in the game. On PS4, you can also use the touchpad to scrape the famous Lucky Tickets, then you will really feel like you’re scraping lottery tickets (with the sound of scraping straight from the PS4 joystick). Finally, in this PS4 version, you’ll also find new playable heroes: Assassin Ray (a character inspired by Edward Kenway, the hero of Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag), Funky Ray (a delusional character that you can unlock by using Uplay points), and Champion Ray (a character who will be offered to the best players of the community and those who live in this community; this character correspond to the new VIP status, visible in the rankings of online challenges).

I hate walking sims but trust me this one is special. The house was so weirdly designed, that it was so interesting..I wished it was a house i could've lived in, especially as a kid. The story are flashbacks of the finch family and their devastating losses throughout their history, the gameplay sprinkled in it/ and while exploring the house was unique and *gasp* dare i say engaging (cause it really was imo). Gameplay and story had me all over the place from chuckling, to gasping in awe, to even tugging at the heart strings. For what this game did it was a masterpiece, even the cons which some people say the game is too short, I think this game was perfect in length.. a little longer and i might've been fatigued of the gameplay/walking loop.

Not content to just rely on storytelling Owlboy also manages some fantastic traversal and combat that truly makes exploring the world a joy. Fantastically clever boss battles and dungeons push you to learn new skills with your companions while not being overly punishing. My only slight critique would be the lack of times juggling party members was necessary. The few times this did occur it was a delight to master how a particular problem would be best addressed by switching between characters on the fly (no pun intended). Old mechanics are rarely reused across dungeons which does rob you of some of those nice moments that come from building upon and mastering skills specific to puzzles and tasks you have previously completed throughout the game.
