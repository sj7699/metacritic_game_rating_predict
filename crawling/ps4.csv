Simply put, the YouTube comparisons don't do this collection justice, because the texture quality has been bumped up by a lot in all three games. Moreover, each game runs in 1080p and presents a crisp and vibrant image compared to the washed out and blurry image of the last gen versions. Frame rate is also 60 FPS in all with some dips here and there. There is also no day one patch for any of the titles, so you can play these games out of the box without a problem. The extras are mind blowing with all DLC thrown in and new features like the developer commentary and concept arts. The packaging is also slick.

5.9,Disgaea 4 Complete+,Strategy|Turn-Based|Tactics|,NIS America,"The ultimate version of Disgaea 4. It has of cause the main game and all content from “Disgaea 4 A promise revisited” including all additional characters, scenarios, gameplay improvements with some from other Disgaea games and some tweaks to the game.  For this game they add a few things that you might miss but are nice to have like for example skill speed ups or an auto save after battles. For me this is the complete or ultimate version of my favorite Disgaea game. The enjoyable crazy story, dark humor, quirky characters and excellent gameplay won me over. To give you an overview over the Disgaea franchise: The Disgaea series are strategy RPGs with unique characters, dark humor and endless possibilities to improve your characters. While other RPGs cap at level 99 here you can reach level 9999 (no typo) and even reincarnate to increase you stats further. You can improve your skills and items also. There is an item world where you can improve all items to ridiculous levels. You can also throw teammates (do this carefully with Prinnies) and later games use fusions and other interesting mechanics. Then there is the humor and characters. It is well interwoven and there are so much good jokes, side-blows and sarcasm. The story is always a good mixture of awesomeness, seriousness, humor and enjoyable character quirks. All games shine in this regard and so far there is no weak entry. The story evolves around a new cast of characters. The main character Valvatorez is a vampire who has not drunk blood in ages because of a promise which weakened him (He was ultimate secret boss level strong back then and a legend). He is a man of his word, non-corruptible and knows well about Sardines. The werewolf Fenrich has chosen him as his master and is his right hand man, absolute loyal but with own ideas. For the rest I avoid spoilers a bit. There is a girl who thinks everything is a dream, a final boss in training, a grim-reaper and a greedy person. Those have great chemistry and work well. Each game has a fantastic cast but those won me over the most. The story starts simple but escalates into a wild and enjoyable ride. So much dark humor, crazy ideas and twist. I fully admit you must like this kind of craziness but if you do not why even play a Disgaea game? In the story and character regard this game fully delivers. The gameplay is great too. It is a turn based strategy RPG. You know the drill here. Move your characters on the map. Attack use your abilities and defeat your enemies. However the Disgaea games have more than most other games. You have colored Geo panels with pyramids given effects. Destroying them can cause chain reactions that damage all characters on them. You can throw characters, build towers with characters, fuse monsters or equip monster characters as weapons, improve items in the item world or characters, gain items with a bonus gouge and much more. The game has a lot of depth and you can easily get 100 hours of playtime out of it in a single playthrough. If you play all content and want to see all I can easily see this past 300 hours. Here a bit of advice: For power leveling: Level 99 enemies give far more experience then they should by comparison. If you get skills that can vanquish a group of those you are fast in the several hundred levels. Stage 5.2 with increased difficulty to 8 is the best level up area for a while. You can link characters together in a way that 10% experience are gained which power level weaker characters in a few minutes. Evilities and skills are very useful and you should look out for them. Fused and monster character weapons are powerful if chosen correctly. Finally there are a lot of useful tricks to find and explore. Presentation wise the game looks and sound amazing. No misstep here and I am a huge fan of the style of the franchise. Overall this is my favorite version of my favorite game. A must play for Disgaea and RPG fans if you can endure the enjoyable craziness.",Nippon Ichi Software,"Oct 29, 2019",83,T

However, if I was being a severe critic of realism I could say that the old school days of arcade NBA Jam style are still alive & well in this version of 2k. This, for Me, makes this My ATF (All-Time Fav) hoops game, & on the PS4 it's just absolutely gorgeous. The only gripe for true purists will be the over-the-top WWEish MyCareer mode which includes cheesy cut-scenes & the innately annoying knack for your counterpart to always be catching fire & carrying his team to an unrealistic degree. Having said that, when you're dropping 20 & 10 in your rookie showcase game you can understand the developers pushing your competition. For those who enjoyed catching fire in the heyday of NBA Jam you'll LOVE 2k14's varying levels of getting ""ON FIRE!!"", including defensively if you make a few good plays on D (steals, blocks, etc). The visuals are stunning, presentation is as realistic as I've ever seen & they even use the Real Voice feature to have real coaches & players during interviews. The online is a different twist on park hoops which allows you to watch & join games going on live by calling ""next"". There's more modes than you'll even have time for which makes for an overwhelmingly awesome full package. NBA 2k14 is the Best Basketball Game Ever.

Worry not! This compilation in combination with 'Kingdom Hearts 2.8: Final Chapter Prologue' offers the perfect way to catch up on the story of one of the most beloved series in gaming history up to this point for quite a decent price. There were some issues when the game first launched mainly due to the 60 frames per second upgrade (excessively fast animations, save crashes and some others); however, Square Enix have thus far been proactive on these issues -- introducing 2 patches within the last two weeks leading up to the English release proving they have indeed listened to community feedback.

The puzzles are pitched at just the right level that they don't delay you too long, but you still feel clever when you work them out. However it's the VR implementation that really shines for me - never before have I felt so in-touch with a VR world - subtle use of the controller vibration and some clever tricks really gave objects in the world a tactile sensation. I spent about 5 minutes just lifting up a dumbbell and a pot-plant trying to work out what the game was doing that made one of them ""feel"" heavier than the other. Outstanding.
